### Introduction 
Hello! This repository is made up of multiple projects that I take on as a Student Assistant at the Cudmore/Santana Lab at the UC Davis Health Department 
of Physiology and Memebrane Biology. So far, you will find projects and explorations pertaining to electrophysiology. Below I will provide a short summary of what can be
found in each project folder. 

### Sinusoidal Regression
In the *SinusoidalRegress* you can find a notebook explaining how to build a Sinusoidal Regression model for sinusoidal data. To do so, you take a fourier transform of the sample distribution and some initial educated guesses on the parameters of a sin wave formula such as amplitude and offset. After, you can then convert it into a formula in numpy which will be fit to your data to model your sinusoidal data. 

### VarAnalysis


The other notebooks will explore non-parametric methods for different explorations, such as bootstrapp
